# Tripixio DAO WHITEPAPER
###### Based on TON Blockchain.

### Introducing
Tripixio DAO's goal is to gather a community of developers who are ready to create projects for users, to improve and strengthen the DAO community with strong projects. All our projects are open source for Product Owners.

### Part 1. Tripixio DAO Jetton (TDJ)
Jetton to distribute shares in the Tripixio DAO team. To receive DDJ, a DAO participant must participate in the development or promotion of existing projects, or create their own, useful for the DAO project. Emission is unlimited.
The amount of TDJ received for the work is determined by general voting (in Tripixio DAO chat), using MultiSig Wallet, where the entire coin issue is stored.  Voting requires 5 TDJ on the wallet balance in order to confirm the vote. Transferring TDJ to a third-party wallet not associated with you/your account and/or transferring an incomplete amount and a portion of it means sharing your stake in Tripixio DAO. To get a DDJ for a project, a vote must be held.

### Part 2. Tripixio DAO NFT (TDN)
Non-Fungible Token Tripixio DAO is used to access DAO projects, allowing you to get a share in the project.

### Part 3. Tripixio DAO Custodial Wallet (TDCW)
Custodial Wallet is used to confirm the vote. There are 2 coins available in the wallet - TDJ for share distribution and TON for commissions and profit.

Voting launch on the wallet is available only in Tripixio DAO chat. Only TDN Holder has access to the chat. To vote you need to have 1% of all TDJ emission on your wallet balance in order to confirm your vote.

### Part 4. Tripixio DAO DNS (3DNS)
Free *.Tripixio DAO.ton for projects inside the DAO.

### Part 5. Tripixio DAO Chat
Chat access is regulated by the bot, and only DDN holders can join. Passing the NFT results in the exclusion of the participant from the chat. Voting in the chat room is for any events.

Adding or excluding bots and users is decided by general voting, where 80% of DAO must vote. Create a vote can any of the admins of the forum

### Part 6. Tripixio DAO Team Roles
РО (Product Owner) becomes the person who created the project or selected by voting of the DAO, one person can not supervise more than 3 projects. PO is the owner of 3DNS for the project. The PO may be re-elected by a vote of the entire DAO. The PO is engaged in the development of the project's whitepaper, which is engaged in recruiting the team, the order within the project's chat room and the distribution of team shares, building processes and interactions within the project You can only submit a project for DDJ collection if you have a complete description of the project.

### Part 7. Tripixio DAO WhitePaper (TDWP)
