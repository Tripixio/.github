# Tripixio DAO WHITEPAPER

#Introducing

Tripixio DAO's goal is to gather a community of developers who are ready to create projects for users, to improve and strengthen the DAO community with strong projects. All our projects are open source for Product Owners.

#Part 1. Tripixio DAO Jetton (TDJ)

Jetton to distribute shares in the Tripixio DAO team. To receive TDJ, a DAO participant must participate in the development or promotion of existing projects, or create their own, useful for the DAO project. Emission is unlimited. The amount of DDJ received for the work is determined by general voting (in DevDao chat), using MultiSig Wallet, where the entire coin issue is stored. Voting requires 5 TDJ on the wallet balance in order to confirm the vote. Transferring DTDJ to a third-party wallet not associated with you/your account and/or transferring an incomplete amount and a portion of it means sharing your stake in Tripixio DAO. To get a TDJ for a project, a vote must be held.
